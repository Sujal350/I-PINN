# I-PINN

This repository contains a Google Colab implementation of Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks (I-PINNs). PINNs are a class of neural networks that incorporate physical laws (expressed as differential equations) into the training process, enabling them to solve forward and inverse problems in scientific computing.

About PINNs

Physics-Informed Neural Networks combine data and known physical laws to:
- Solve partial differential equations (PDEs)
- Model physical systems accurately
- Generalize better when limited data is available

Applications include:
- Computational fluid dynamics
- Heat transfer
- Structural analysis
- Geophysics
